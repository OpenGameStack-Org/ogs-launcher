# Manual Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide documents comprehensive manual testing of the OGS Launcher across two deployment scenarios:
1. **Editor-Mode Testing** — Testing within the Godot editor (main.tscn) for rapid feedback
2. **Installed-Build Testing** — Testing an exported OGS Launcher binary to verify production packaging

These tests verify user-facing functionality that complements the automated test suite and uncover issues that only occur in real execution environments.

## Test Philosophy

- **Editor Mode:** Rapid iteration, quick hypothesis testing, component isolation
- **Installed Mode:** Real-world usage patterns, packaging validation, user experience verification
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Each test builds on previous findings; report blockers immediately before proceeding to the next test

## Sample Projects

Two sample projects are provided in `samples/` for testing:

| Sample | Purpose | Config | Structure |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **sample_project** | Development/linked-mode testing | force_offline=false | Tools expected in library (missing state) |
| **sample_project_sealed** | Sealed/air-gapped project testing | force_offline=true | Tools physically embedded in project |

Both samples have `stack.json` with Godot 4.3 and Blender 4.5.7.

# PART A: EDITOR-MODE TESTING

## Prerequisites (Editor Mode)

- OGS Launcher running in Godot editor (F5 or Run Scene on main.tscn)
- Two sample projects available in `samples/` directory
- Output console visible for error messages
- Fresh state: clean library directory for consistent results

### Achieving Fresh State (Before Starting Tests)

To ensure a clean slate for testing, delete all persistent launcher data:

**IMPORTANT:** Back up any existing projects, tools, or settings you want to keep before deleting data. Fresh-state cleanup is destructive and cannot be undone.

**NOTE ON AUTOMATED TESTS:** The automated test suite uses a completely isolated test library (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\OGS_TEST\Library`) and does not affect your production data at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OGS`. You can safely run automated tests at any time without impacting manual testing data. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md#test-library-isolation) for details.

**Option A: Using PowerShell (Recommended)**
```powershell
# Remove all OGS launcher data
Remove-Item -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\OGS" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Verify deletion
if (-not (Test-Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\OGS")) {
    Write-Host "✓ Fresh state achieved: OGS directory removed"
} else {
    Write-Host "✗ Failed to remove OGS directory"
}
```

**Option B: Using File Explorer (Manual)**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Press Ctrl+L and paste: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OGS`
3. If the `OGS` folder exists, delete it entirely
4. Close File Explorer

**Option C: Inside Godot Editor**
1. In Godot, open the Output panel for logs
2. Use PowerShell or File Explorer to delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OGS`
3. Confirm the onboarding wizard appears on next launch

### Verifying Fresh State

After cleanup, verify the fresh state is achieved:

**In PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Confirm directories don't exist
$ogsPath = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\OGS"
if (Test-Path $ogsPath) {
    Write-Host "OGS directory still exists (not clean)"
} else {
    Write-Host "✓ Clean: No OGS directory"
}
```

**In Godot Editor:**
- Press F5 to start the launcher
- Onboarding wizard **must** appear (indicates first-run detection working)
- If no wizard appears, fresh state was not achieved

**After First Launch:**
```powershell
# Check that launcher created default structure
dir "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\OGS\"
# Should show: Library, logs, ogs_launcher_settings.json, ogs_wizard_complete.txt
```

### Editor Test 1: Launcher Startup & Onboarding

**Objective:** Verify that the launcher starts without errors and displays the onboarding wizard on first run.

**Steps:**
1. Delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OGS` (to simulate first run)
2. Press F5 or click Run Scene on main.tscn
3. Observe the launcher window and any dialogs
4. In the onboarding wizard, click **Start**
5. Wait for the wizard to close and the main window to remain open
6. Verify `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OGS` exists and contains `Library` and `ogs_wizard_complete.txt`

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Launcher window appears without errors
- ✅ Scene tree loads with no "Parse Error" or compilation failures
- ✅ All page buttons visible in sidebar (Projects, Engine, Tools, Settings)

# PART B: INSTALLED-BUILD TESTING

## Prerequisites (Installed Build)

- OGS Launcher exported as a Windows binary (ogs_launcher.exe or similar)
- Export includes all necessary DLLs, assets, and scripts
- Two sample projects available in `samples/` directory (relative to launcher or absolute path)
- Fresh state: launcher run with clean %LOCALAPPDATA%/OGS directory (simulate first user)
- Administrator access NOT required (launcher is portable)

### Achieving Fresh State for Installed Tests

Before running Installed Tests, clean up any previous launcher data to simulate a first-time user:

**IMPORTANT:** Back up any existing projects, tools, or settings you want to keep before deleting data. Fresh-state cleanup is destructive and cannot be undone.

**PowerShell One-Liner:**
```powershell
Remove-Item -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\OGS" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; Write-Host "✓ Fresh state ready"
```

**Verification After Export:**
1. Double-click `ogs_launcher.exe` to launch the exported binary
2. The **Onboarding wizard must appear** (confirms first-run detection)
3. Check that `%LOCALAPPDATA%/OGS/` directory was created
4. Confirm `%LOCALAPPDATA%/OGS/Library/` is empty (no pre-populated tools)

If onboarding wizard does NOT appear, fresh state was not achieved. Repeat the cleanup and relaunch.

### Installed Test 1: Launcher Export & First Launch

**Objective:** Verify that the exported launcher binary starts correctly and detects first-run state.

**Steps:**
1. Build/export OGS Launcher as a standalone Windows executable
2. Place the executable and all supporting files in a clean directory
3. Ensure %LOCALAPPDATA%/OGS directory does NOT exist (simulating first user)
4. Launch the executable by double-clicking it
5. Observe window appearance and any dialogs

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Launcher window opens without errors or crashes
- ✅ Window title bar shows "OGS Launcher" or similar
- ✅ All UI elements (sidebar buttons, page content) render correctly
- ✅ Projects page is default/active
- ✅ Onboarding wizard appears (welcome dialog)
- ✅ %LOCALAPPDATA%/OGS/Library directory is created automatically

**Pass Criteria:**
- Launcher binary is portable and runs without external dependencies
- First-run detection works (onboarding appears)
- Launcher creates required directories

**If test fails:**
- Check that all required DLLs are included in export
- Verify launcher binary is 64-bit (matches system architecture)
- Confirm %LOCALAPPDATA% path is correctly resolved on user's system

---

### Installed Test 2: Load sample_project (Development Mode)

**Objective:** Verify the same project loading behavior as Editor Test 2, but in installed context.

**Steps:**
1. Close onboarding wizard
2. Click "Browse" button
3. Navigate to `samples/sample_project` (adjust path if samples are in a different location)
4. Click "Select This Folder"
5. Click "Load" button
6. Observe state

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Project loads without errors
- ✅ Tools list shows "godot v4.3" and "blender v4.5.7"
- ✅ Missing tools show **⚠️ yellow warning triangle** indicators
- ✅ "Seal for Delivery" button is disabled

**Steps:**
1. From Installed Test 1 (fresh launcher), navigate to Settings page
2. In "Mirror Root:" field, type or browse to a custom path (e.g., `C:\MyOGSMirror\`)
3. In "Remote Repo URL:" field, paste a test URL
4. Close the launcher completely
5. Wait a few seconds
6. Relaunch the launcher (double-click executable again)
7. Navigate back to Settings page
8. Check if your custom path and URL are still there

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Custom mirror root path is preserved in "Mirror Root:" field
- ✅ Custom remote repo URL is preserved in "Remote Repo URL:" field

### Console Debugging (Both Modes)

**In Editor Mode:**
- Check Godot Output panel (View → Output in editor)
- Look for SCRIPT ERROR, Parse Error, or Compile Error messages
- Expected (ignore): "ERROR: Parse JSON failed" during validation tests

**In Installed Mode:**
- Launcher writes logs to: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/OGS/logs/ogs_launcher.log`
- Check this file for structured JSON logs after each test
- Look for error entries with "error_code" or "error_message" fields

**Common Diagnostic Checks:**
```
# Check if library directories exist:
dir %LOCALAPPDATA%\OGS\Library\

# Check if settings persisted:
type %LOCALAPPDATA%\OGS\ogs_launcher_settings.json

# Check latest logs:
type %LOCALAPPDATA%\OGS\logs\ogs_launcher.log | findstr "error\|ERROR"
```

## Reporting Test Results

After each editor test, provide:
1. **Test number and name**
2. **Pass/Fail/Partial** status
3. **Observations** — what actually happened
4. **Blockers** — did this prevent the next test?
5. **Console output** — any errors seen

Example:
```
**Editor Test 2: Load sample_project — PASS ✅**

Observations:
- Project loaded successfully
- Tools list shows godot and blender correctly
- Missing tools show ⚠️ yellow warning indicators
- Seal button disabled with correct tooltip

Blockers: None
Console: No errors
```

After completing all editor tests, move to installed-build testing with same reporting format.

## Future Enhancement Areas (Not Tested Yet)

- Integration with Git LFS for tool distribution
- Hardened Godot build verification
- RMF evidence generation and audit logs
- Multi-project library management (when multiple projects use same tools)
- Custom tool addition (beyond standard profile)
- Tool version upgrade workflows
