# OGS Launcher: Minimum Viable Product & Development Plan

## Vision Alignment
This plan realizes the core vision from `docs/Design_Doc.md`: **"Sovereignty Over Subscription."** The MoSCoW method ensures we deliver the critical path to air-gap functionality and manifest-driven toolchain management without overscoping.

---

## MVP Definition: The "I/ITSEC Showcase" Build
**Target Date:** November 1, 2026 (Ready for Conference)
**Target Platform:** Windows 10/11 (x64)
**Distribution Model:** "Hub" installer (for devs) to "Sealed" artifact (for delivery)

### Primary Goals (Phase 1.5: Showcase Readiness)
1.  **Central Library Manager (Mode A)** — Launcher manages a shared pool of tools in `%LOCALAPPDATA%` to save disk space.
2.  **Project "Hydration"** — Opening a project automatically links it to the correct version in the Library (or triggers a download).
3.  **The "Seal" Protocol (Mode B)** — A working button that physically copies tools from the Library into the project and zips it up.
4.  **Offline Demo Bundle** — A pre-sealed project on a USB stick to guarantee a working demo regardless of conference Wi-Fi.

### Success Criteria
*   User runs `OGS_Setup.exe` to install the Launcher.
*   Launcher detects missing tools in `stack.json` and downloads them to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/OGS/Library/`.
*   User can have 3 projects using "Godot 4.3" while only having one copy of Godot on disk.
*   User clicks **"Seal for Delivery,"** and the Launcher produces a standalone `.zip` file containing the project AND the embedded tools.
*   That `.zip` file can be moved to a disconnected PC and run immediately.

### Demo Walkthrough (MVP Completion Gate)
The MVP is not complete until this full sequence works end to end:
1.  On a connected laptop, download and install the Launcher.
2.  Import an existing Godot project and generate `stack.json` (convert to OGS project).
3.  Use the Launcher to hydrate tools into the Central Library.
4.  Click **"Seal for Delivery"** to export a sealed `.zip` with embedded tools and Launcher.
5.  Transfer the `.zip` to an air-gapped PC, unzip, and run the Launcher from inside the sealed folder.
6.  Launch Godot (and the sample project) successfully with no network access.

---

### Phase 3: Mid-Term Enhancements (March-May 2026)
**Status:** Planned
*Focus: Multi-tool operations, advanced UI, and performance optimization.*

**Multi-Tool Operations:**
*   Multi-select downloads (select multiple tools in Available section, "Download All Selected" button)
*   "Download All for Project" button on Projects page (one-click install all missing tools)
*   Download queue management (queue multiple tools, download sequentially with unified progress)

**Advanced UI:**
*   Collapsible category/tool/version sections (avoid overwhelming UI as repository grows)
*   Version filtering (show only latest, show all, show only versions needed by projects)
*   Tool search and filtering (find tools by name, category, or version)

**Library Management:**
*   Tool uninstall capability (remove unused tools from library to reclaim disk space)
*   Library disk usage analytics (show space used per tool, total library size)
*   Cleanup recommendations (identify unused tools across all projects)

**Performance & Caching:**
*   Cache remote repository.json locally (reduce network calls, faster startup)
*   Lazy-load tool metadata (only fetch details when user expands category)
*   Background refresh (check for repository updates without blocking UI)

---

### Phase 4: Long-Term Vision (Post-Showcase/Backlog)
**Status:** Future
*Focus: Advanced workflows, compliance, and ecosystem expansion.*

*   **Git LFS Integration** — Advanced workflow for Git-based teams to version-control tool binaries
