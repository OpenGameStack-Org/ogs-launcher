# Testing Guide

## Overview

The OGS Launcher uses a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability and maintainability. Tests are categorized into **unit tests** (pure logic, no UI) and **scene tests** (integration tests with UI nodes).

For **manual user-facing tests** (UI workflows with sample projects), see [MANUAL_TESTING.md](MANUAL_TESTING.md).

## Running Tests

Execute the full test suite in headless mode:

**PowerShell (Windows) - Recommended:**
```powershell
$start = Get-Date; & "C:\Program Files\Godot_v4.3-stable_win64\Godot_v4.3-stable_win64.exe" --headless --script res://tests/test_runner.gd 2>&1 | Select-Object -Last 10; $elapsed = ((Get-Date) - $start).TotalSeconds; Write-Host "Exit code: $LASTEXITCODE (execution time: $elapsed seconds)"
```

This command:
- Captures stdout and stderr with `2>&1`
- Pipes output to force proper handling
- Measures and displays execution time
- Shows the last 10 lines of output plus exit code

**Bash (Linux/macOS):**
```bash
godot --headless --script res://tests/test_runner.gd
```

Expected output:
```
TestRunner: Test library isolated to C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local/OGS_TEST/Library
tests passed: 205
tests failed: 0
TestRunner: Cleaned up test library at C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local/OGS_TEST/Library
```

The test runner automatically exits when complete (~3.4-4.6 seconds) without requiring manual termination.

**Notes:**
- You may see `ERROR: Parse JSON failed` messages during test runs. These are expected from tests that validate invalid JSON handling.
- The test runner uses `_process()` callback to ensure proper scene tree initialization before calling `quit()`, allowing clean process termination on all platforms.

## Test Library Isolation

**Important:** Tests use a completely isolated library directory to prevent any conflicts with production data or other running instances of OGS Launcher.

### How It Works

1. **test_runner.gd** automatically sets environment variable `OGS_LIBRARY_ROOT` to an isolated test path before running any tests
2. **PathResolver.get_library_root()** checks for this environment variable first:
   - If `OGS_LIBRARY_ROOT` is set → all tests use that path
   - If not set → falls back to normal production paths
3. All tests operate within this isolated directory (typically `LOCALAPPDATA/OGS_TEST/Library` on Windows)
4. After all tests complete, **test_runner.gd automatically cleans up** the entire test library directory

### Production Safety

✅ **Your production `LOCALAPPDATA/OGS/Library` is never touched by tests**
✅ **Can safely run tests while the real OGS Launcher is running**
✅ **No resource conflicts or data loss risk**
✅ **Each test run starts with a clean slate and leaves no residue**

### Custom Test Library Path

For advanced scenarios, you can override the test library path with your own:

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:OGS_LIBRARY_ROOT = "C:\MyTestLibrary"
& "C:\Program Files\Godot_v4.3-stable_win64\Godot_v4.3-stable_win64.exe" --headless --script res://tests/test_runner.gd
```

**Bash:**
```bash
export OGS_LIBRARY_ROOT=/tmp/ogs_test_lib
godot --headless --script res://tests/test_runner.gd
```

The test runner will clean up this custom path after tests complete.

## Test Categories

  - Launch button enabled after valid project load
  - Launch with no selection → error message

### Startup Tests (Initialization Verification)

- **[tests/startup_tests.gd](tests/startup_tests.gd)** — Verifies launcher initialization without errors (3 tests).
  - Main scene loads and instantiates successfully
  - All required UI nodes exist and are accessible (13 critical nodes)
  - Script validation: main.gd is properly formed and instantiable

## Test Structure

Each test suite:
1. Extends `RefCounted`
2. Has a `class_name` for registration
3. Implements `run() -> Dictionary` returning `{"passed": int, "failed": int, "failures": Array[String]}`
4. Uses `_expect(condition, message, results)` helper for assertions

### Example Unit Test

```gdscript
extends RefCounted
class_name MyFeatureTests

func run() -> Dictionary:
    var results := {"passed": 0, "failed": 0, "failures": []}
    _test_valid_input(results)
    _test_invalid_input(results)
    return results

func _expect(condition: bool, message: String, results: Dictionary) -> void:
    if condition:
        results["passed"] += 1
    else:
        results["failed"] += 1
        results["failures"].append(message)

func _test_valid_input(results: Dictionary) -> void:
    var config = MyFeature.load("valid_data")
    _expect(config.is_valid(), "valid data should pass", results)
```

### Example Scene Test

```gdscript
extends RefCounted
class_name MyControllerSceneTests

func run() -> Dictionary:
    var results := {"passed": 0, "failed": 0, "failures": []}
    _test_ui_interaction(results)
    return results

func _test_ui_interaction(results: Dictionary) -> void:
    var controller = MyController.new()
    var label = Label.new()
    controller.setup(label)
    controller.do_something()
    _expect(label.text == "Expected", "label should update", results)
    label.free()  # Clean up to avoid leaks
```

## Adding New Tests

### 1. Create Test File

Create a new test file in `tests/` with `class_name`:

```gdscript
extends RefCounted
class_name MyNewTests
```

### 2. Register in Test Runner

Add to [tests/test_runner.gd](tests/test_runner.gd):

```gdscript
var my_new_tests = load("res://tests/my_new_tests.gd")
if my_new_tests:
    test_suites.append(my_new_tests.new())
```

### 3. Run and Verify

```bash
godot --headless --script res://tests/test_runner.gd
```

## Best Practices

### General
- Write tests alongside new features (don't defer testing)
- Keep tests focused: one assertion per test method when possible
- Use descriptive test method names (`_test_empty_path_shows_error` over `_test_1`)

### Unit Tests
- Test both valid and invalid inputs
- Verify error codes/messages explicitly
- Avoid file I/O when possible (use in-memory data)

### Scene Tests
- Always free created UI nodes to avoid resource leaks
- Test user-facing behaviors, not internal implementation
- Use sample data from `samples/` when testing file loading

### Cleanup
- Free all created nodes in scene tests
- Delete temporary files created during tests
- Avoid leaving state that could affect subsequent tests

## Continuous Integration

All pull requests must pass the test suite. The CI pipeline runs:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Godot_v4.3-stable_win64\Godot_v4.3-stable_win64.exe" --headless --script res://tests/test_runner.gd
```

Exit code 0 = all tests passed; exit code 1 = failures detected.

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Hang or Don't Complete

- Check for infinite loops in test logic
- Ensure all UI nodes are freed (resource leaks can cause hangs)
- Run with `--verbose` to see detailed output

### "Class not found" Errors

- Ensure `class_name` is declared in the source file
- Add preload statements in `test_runner.gd` if needed
- Open the project in Godot editor once to register classes

### Resource Leak Warnings

Scene tests must free all created nodes:

```gdscript
func _test_something(results: Dictionary) -> void:
    var label = Label.new()
    # ... test logic ...
    label.free()  # Critical: always free
```

## Coverage Goals

Target coverage for all new features:
- **Business logic** → 100% unit test coverage
- **UI controllers** → Scene tests for critical user flows
- **Utilities** → Unit tests for edge cases and error handling
