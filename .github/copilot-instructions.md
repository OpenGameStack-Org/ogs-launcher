## **Project Mission: Open Game Stack (OGS)**

**Vision:** "Sovereignty Over Subscription." OGS is a portable, pre-configured development environment that bundles open-source tools into version-controlled **"Frozen Stacks."**

### **1. Core Architectural Rules**

* **Version Control Everything:** The environment is the artifact. Tools are bundled and version-controlled.
* **Air-Gap First:** All features must function in a strictly offline, air-gapped environment. No external network sockets or "phone home" telemetry.
* **MOSA & RMF Compliance:** Follow Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) objectives. Code should be modular, portable, and meet defense simulation standards.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Avoid external installers, registry keys, or `%APPDATA%` usage. Everything must run from a single, portable folder.

### **2. Tech Stack & Syntax Preferences**

* **Primary Engine:** **Godot 4.3 (Stable)**. Strictly use Godot 4.3 GDScript syntax (e.g., use `instantiate()` instead of `instance()`, and new `@export` annotations).
* **Frozen Stack Tools:** Target compatibility for Blender 4.2 LTS, Krita 5.2, and Audacity 3.7.
* **Implementation Language:** Primarily GDScript for the launcher; Bash/PowerShell for tool management scripts.

### **3. Coding Standards for Copilot**

* **Documentation:** Every new function must include a clear docstring explaining its purpose in the context of the OGS lifecycle.
* **Project Vision Reference:** Always refer to `design_doc.md` for the overarching architectural vision before proposing structural changes.
* **Privacy & Security:** Do not suggest libraries that require cloud-based authentication or proprietary license validation.
* **Modularity:** Propose modular code structures that allow for easy swapping of tools or components in the future.
* **Testing & Validation:** 
  - Write tests alongside new features (unit tests for logic, scene tests for UI interactions).
  - All unit tests must extend `RefCounted`, declare `class_name`, and implement `run() -> Dictionary`.
  - Scene tests must free all created UI nodes to avoid resource leaks.
  - Update [docs/TESTING.md](../docs/TESTING.md) when adding new test categories or changing test patterns.
  - New features require tests before merging; existing tests must continue to pass.
* **Performance:** Optimize for minimal resource usage, especially in offline mode. Avoid unnecessary background processes or network calls.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling that provides clear feedback to the user without crashing the application, especially in air-gapped environments.
* **User Experience:** Prioritize a simple, intuitive user interface for the OGS Launcher that abstracts away complexity while providing necessary controls for both indie developers and enterprise users.
* **Security Best Practices:** Ensure that all code adheres to security best practices, especially when handling file operations or user input, to prevent vulnerabilities in the launcher or tool management scripts.

### **4. Development Tracking**

* See [docs/The_Plan.md](../docs/The_Plan.md) for the MVP definition, current progress, and development roadmap.
* Tasks are marked as completed (✅) and in-progress (🔄) as work advances.
* The plan ties directly to [docs/Design_Doc.md](../docs/Design_Doc.md) for architectural vision.
* All pull requests must pass the manifest test suite: `godot --headless --script res://tests/test_runner.gd`
