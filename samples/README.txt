Sample projects for testing OGS Launcher workflows.

- sample_project: Development/linked-mode sample (force_offline=false)
- sample_project_sealed: Sealed-style sample structure (force_offline=true)

Both samples are intentionally lightweight and focus on manifest/config structure.
Tool binaries in these samples are placeholders, not runnable production tool bundles.
